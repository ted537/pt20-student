All test cases are contained in the /test/scanner directory
Each test case has a .pt and .expected file
	The .pt file is the PT Pascal program run to test a specific case
	The .expected file is the expected output from this test case
All test cases were ran and gave their expected output which can be seen in the .expected file

multi_comment.pt	
	Test that the new Like comments of form (/*  comment  */) were recognized by the scanner
	
single_comment.pt
	Test that the new Like comments of form (// hello) were recognized by the scanner
	
The .pt files in /test/scanner/identifiers tests that the new Like identifiers are recognized
A new Like keyword is tested in get.pt
	The output shows that it is recognized as an identifier
An old PT Pascal keyword (ex. write) is still recognized as an identifier


null_string.pt
	Test that null strings are allowed in Like scanner
	
single_quote.pt
	Test that old string syntax ('hello') is no longer recognized by scanner
	
string_literal.pt and valid_string.pt
	Test that new string syntax ("hello") is recognized by scanner

keywords.pt
	Test both old and new keywords
	Old keywords are recognized just as identifiers and are not screened to anything
	New keywords are recognized as keywords and are screened (ex. choose is screened to pChoose)
	
tokens.pt
	Tests all the new tokens added in Like (ex. +=)
	Check that each token is recognized (ex. += is recognized as .pPlusEquals)

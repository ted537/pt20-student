# Phase 3 Testing Documentation

**All test cases for phase 3 are contained within the /test/semantic directory**

### Testing Structure
Each test case has a .pt and a .expected file
* The .pt file is the PT Pascal program run to test a specific case
* The .expected file is the expected output from the test case as
determined by the Like program specifications.

All test cases were ran using `ssltrace` and the expected behaviour
was achieved

### How to Run the Tests
All tests can be run by running `./test.sh` in the base directory of the 
project
